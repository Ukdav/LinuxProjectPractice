## LinuxProjectPractice Project 1

**What is Linux**?

A Linux is a program or utility that runs on the CLI-a console that interacts with the system via text and processes, it is similar to the command prompt application in Windows. In addition, it is executed on Terminal by pressing Enter at the end of the line, you can run commands to perform various tasks, from package installation to user management and file manipulation.

We would be testing some of the Linus Commands on this first Project.

**1. SUDO COMMAND**

It is the short form for SuperUser Do, Sudo is one of the most popular basic Linux commands that lets you perform tasks that require administrative or root permission.

You must make sure you have administrative privileges to perform this operation.

**2. PWD COMMAND**

The pwd command is used to print the current working directory in the terminal. Simply typing Enter, this will display the full path of the current directory you are in.

**3. CD COMMAND**

The cd command is used to change the current working directory in the terminal. Running this command without an option will take you to the home folder. keep in mind that only users with *SUDO privileges* can execute it.
![cd](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/fdf94ef6-95a9-4c52-b84b-f183ba7a0618)

Here are some shortcut to help you navigate:

cd ~ {Username} goes to another user's home directory

cd .. Moves one director upward

cd - moves you to your previous directory

**4. ls COMMAND**

This is an Ls command in the Ubuntu terminal that is used to list the files and directories in the current working directory, it provides a way of viewing the content of a directory. here are a few examples.
