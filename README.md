## LinuxProjectPractice Project 1

**What is Linux**?

A Linux is a program or utility that runs on the CLI-a console that interacts with the system via text and processes, it is similar to the command prompt application in Windows. In addition, it is executed on Terminal by pressing Enter at the end of the line, you can run commands to perform various tasks, from package installation to user management and file manipulation.

We would be testing some of the Linus Commands on this first Project.

**1. SUDO COMMAND**

It is the short form for SuperUser Do, Sudo is one of the most popular basic Linux commands that lets you perform tasks that require administrative or root permission.
![sudo command](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/6063043a-6ef9-455d-bde2-0821553a44ec)

You must make sure you have administrative privileges to perform this operation.

**2. PWD COMMAND**

The pwd command is used to print the current working directory in the terminal. Simply typing Enter, this will display the full path of the current directory you are in.
![PWD Command](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/2dc52458-5f96-4af6-81e6-20974fe3c373)


**3. CD COMMAND**

The cd command is used to change the current working directory in the terminal. Running this command without an option will take you to the home folder. keep in mind that only users with *SUDO privileges* can execute it.
![cd](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/fdf94ef6-95a9-4c52-b84b-f183ba7a0618)

Here are some shortcut to help you navigate:

cd ~ {Username} goes to another user's home directory

cd .. Moves one director upward

cd - moves you to your previous directory

**4. ls COMMAND**

This is an Ls command in the Ubuntu terminal that is used to list the files and directories in the current working directory, it provides a way of viewing the content of a directory. here are a few examples.

![LS COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/a932ca6e-e9a0-4f75-8216-1bfcb5922882)

other commands are :
ls -R

ls -a and ls -1h

![LS -R COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/46ed46e9-946e-4684-92c3-5615a80c3083)
![LS -a and LS -1h COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/3d6fd136-65e2-427a-8426-b21e0e5def1e)

**5. CAT COMMAND**

The cat command in the Ubuntu terminal is used to display the contents of text files. it's a short word for "concatenate", and its primary  use is to display the contents of one or more files. it's also commonly used to create new files, combine files and redirect content. for example:
![CAT COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/445a06cc-867c-45cd-92c3-4b4a2c1c6f5d)

TAC command display contents in a reverse order

![TAC COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/98d59aea-01db-4e44-8769-d3041acf27ae)

**6. CP COMMAND**

The cp command in the Ubuntu terminal is used to copy files or directories from one location to another. It stands for  "copy" and is followed by the source file/directory path and destination path to which you want to copy the files/directories to. for example:
![CP COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/98538682-7e4c-45ff-b155-360e81018503)

**7. MV COMMAND**
The mv command in Ubuntu (and other Linux-based systems) is used to move or rename files and directories. It stands for  "move" but it is also commonly used for renaming because the process involves changing the name and location of the specified directory. for example, you can use the mv command to move a file from one directory to another or rename a file by specifying a new name in the directory.
![MV COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/dd121550-75c1-4b9f-ac82-6771e533df90)

**8. MKDIR COMMAND**
The `mkdir` command in the Ubuntu terminal is used to create new directories (folders). You can use it to make a new directory within the current working directory or specify a full path to create a directory in a specific location. For example, typing `mkdir Ifyfolder` will create a new directory named "Ifyfolder" in the current directory.
![MKDIR COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/cf2d26a3-f556-4879-97f1-11e532a7a0c2)

**9. RMDIR COMMAND**
The `rmdir` command in the Ubuntu terminal is used to remove empty directories (folders). It deletes a directory only if it is empty; otherwise, it will show an error. For instance, if you have an empty directory named "Ifyfolder" and you want to remove it, you can use the command `rmdir Ifyfolder`. If the directory contains any files or subdirectories, you would need to use the `rm` command with the `-r` (recursive) option to remove them first before using `rmdir`.
![RMDIR COMMAND](https://github.com/Ukdav/LinuxProjectPractice/assets/139593350/7e3d3df4-fe05-41ef-82bf-bc09ec30419f)
